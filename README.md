# electron-vue

It is my second electron project using https://www.electronforge.io/, which I combine it with vue.js.
For this project, I build mailbox that allow you to enter your email and password (gmail account, which you should to make you google account in less secure mode).
Basically, since my first project cannot be packaged as windows .exe, then I re-create it. It's the link : https://github.com/yusronhanan/electron-vue/

You can run it using 'npm start' or just install the 'Mailbox Setup.exe' on your windows.

You need to run the server too which I build it using express.js and epsitec-imap-simple for fetch the email (subject, from, and date), here : https://github.com/yusronhanan/express-imap
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run it
